Description
-----------
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) sites play a key role in the formation of protein complex which is the basis of a variety of biological processes. Experimental methods to solve PPI sites are expensive and time-consuming, which leads to the development of different kinds of prediction algorithms. We propose a convolutional neural network for PPI sites prediction and use residue binding propensity to improve the positive samples. Our method obtains a remarkable result of the area under curve (AUC)=0.912 on the improved data set. In addition, it yields much better results on samples with high binding propensity than on randomly selected samples. This suggests that there are considerable false positive PPI sites in the positive samples defined by distance between residue atoms.

__USAGE__

1. Feature Extraction:

You can extract the features described in our paper. 
	
2. The training and testing is pretty simple. Just follow the following steps:

* Put feature files of each complex in a fold. 

* Run leave_one_complex.py, then you can get AUC of each complex by using leave-one-complex-out validation.

* Run kfold.py, then you can get the result of 5-fold cross-validation.

_We tested our model on 8  Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4112 CPU @ 2.60GHz and NVIDIA Corporation GP102 [TITAN Xp] (rev a1)._
